# `geraccoredeps`
*The default implementation of the core dependencies of the C target for the Gera programming language.*

<br><br>

This repository contains an implementation of all headers and functions that the C target of the Gera programming language needs.

This implementation depends on libc, meaning if you plan on compiling to a target which does not support libc, you will need to implement this set of functions yourself.

This repository is cloned by default by `gerap` when compiling for the C target and no custom implementation is provided.

## Expectations by Gera

Gera expects `gera.h` and `geracoredeps.h` to be provided in the exact same form they are provided here.

`geratypes.h` may be modified, but `GeraFreeHandler`, `GeraAllocation`, `GeraArray`, `GeraString`, `gfloat`, `gint` and `gbool` are all expected to be defined in the exact same way they are defined here.

`geracoredeps.c` has to exist at the directory root to be included in the compilation by default by `gerap`.
